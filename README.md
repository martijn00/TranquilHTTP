# Tranquil HTTP
Tranquil HTTP is a C# HTTP library for Mobile Development aiming to make it really easy to solve complex HTTP communication scenarios.

To accomplish this Tranquil HTTP wraps arround the excellent work of Paul Betts by incorporating two of his open-source libraries "[ModernHttpClient](https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient)" and "[Fusillade](https://github.com/paulcbetts/Fusillade)". 

The idea of Tranquil HTTP is heavily based on the article "[Resilient network services with mobile Xamarin apps](http://arteksoftware.com/resilient-network-services-with-xamarin/)" by Rob Gibbens. 

## Installation
You can install Tranquil HTTP through NuGet. Simply run the following command in the [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-manager-console):
```
Install-Package TranquilHTTP
```
